# Site Contact Info Footer Block

This Drupal module provides site contact information as a block for the site footer. The information is editable in a custom administration form.

The block provides information about a given site including:

- Address
- Email
- Fax
- Phone

The templates for rendering this block are located in the theme. This module simply installs the block itself and an admin form for populating the information.
